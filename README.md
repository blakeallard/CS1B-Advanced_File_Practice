This program demonstrates how to write an array of integers to a binary file and then read it back into memory in C++. The program uses fstream to perform both input and output operations on a binary file, allowing the array of integers to be saved and loaded efficiently.

Key Features:
Writing to Binary File: The program writes an array of integers to a binary file (numbers.dat) using fstream with the ios::out and ios::binary flags.

Reading from Binary File: The binary data is read back into the same array using fstream with the ios::in and ios::binary flags.

Array Handling: The program works with a fixed-size array of integers (SIZE = 10), showing how to store and retrieve array data in binary format.

Error Handling: Includes checks for file opening errors.

Skills Demonstrated:
Binary File Operations: Writing and reading binary data from a file using fstream.

Array Manipulation: Storing and retrieving array data from files, ensuring data integrity.

File Error Handling: Properly handling file I/O errors with conditional checks.

Type Casting: Using reinterpret_cast<char*> to read and write the binary data correctly from an array of integers.

Files Included:
main.cpp â€“ Contains the main logic for writing an array of integers to a binary file and reading it back.
